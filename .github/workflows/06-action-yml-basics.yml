          echo "1. 'inputs' define what data action accepts"
          echo "2. 'outputs' define what data action returns"
          echo "3. 'runs' defines HOW action executes (docker/node/composite)"
          echo "4. Use 'with:' to pass inputs"
          echo "5. Use 'steps.<id>.outputs.<name>' to read outputs"
